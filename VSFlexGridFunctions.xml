             Grid rows and cols are considered 1-based.  You can specify a 
             subset of the grid by providing the optional values for 
             rowMin, rowMax, colMin, colMax.  The benchmark and the actual 
             will be stored as TAB delimited files.
             Typically, benchmarks are stored in the Datapool\Bench directory.

             Typically, benchmarks are stored in the Datapool\Bench directory.  
             In that event, only the filename.ext is needed.  
             Benchmarks and captures will be TAB delimited files.

               The benchmark file is located within the Project at Datapool\Bench\bench.ext<br />

               The difference file is located within the Project at Datapool\Dif\bench.ext<br />
               Since no optional block parameters were provided, the entire 
               grid is captured and compared.  This is NOT recommended for 
               large grids as this can take much time.
