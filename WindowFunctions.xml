                 Performs a WindowVP CompareImage OR a RegionImageVP on an object.
              </short_desc>
              <detailed_desc> 
                <p>Performs a WindowVP CompareImage OR a RegionImageVP on an object.  
                The benchmark VP must already exist and be an asset of the currently 
                running script.</p>
                <p>
                A RegionImageVP can be accomplished by having the name of the VP as an item 
                under the component in the application map.  The item's value must be 
                the coordinate values required by the RegionImageVP (i.e. "65,100,200,250").</p>
                <p>
                Example 1: Perform a WindowVP CompareImage</p>
                <p>
                MainWindow SomeWindowObject VerifyImage StoredVP</p>
                <p>
                (no StoredVP item found in the app map under SomeWindowObject)</p>
                <p>
                The named VP (StoredVP) must not exist in the application map.  The 
                entire panel/object of SomeWindowObject will be captured and compared 
                against the StoredVP baseline which must already exist as an asset of the
                currently running script.</p>
                <p>
                Example 2: Perform a RegionImageVP on a particular area of the screen</p>
                <p>
                MainWindow SomeWindowObject VerifyImage StoredVP</p>
                <p>
                (StoredVP found as:</p>
                <p> 
                "65,100,200,250"   OR
                "Coords=65,100,200,250"</p>
                <p>  
                in the SomeWindowObject section of the app map)</p>
                <p>
                The named VP (StoredVP) is found to exist in the application map as a
                subitem in the SomeWindowObject section of the map.  This causes 
                the routine to attempt a RegionImageVP using the map's value of the StoredVP 
                item as the coordinates for the region to capture.  StoredVP is ALSO the 
                name of the VP which must already exist as an asset of the currently 
                running script.</p>

                under the component in the application map.  The item's value must be

                EXAMPLE 1 : Perform a WindowVP CompareImage before OCR Test</p>
                <p>

                (no StoredVP item found in the app map under SomeWindowObject)</p>
                <p>
                The named VP (StoredVP) must not exist in the application map if you 
                intend to compare the entire window.  The entire panel/object of 
                SomeWindowObject will be captured and compared against the StoredVP 
                baseline.  This VP must already exist as an asset of the
                currently running script.</p>
                <p>
                EXAMPLE 2 : Perform a RegionImageVP before the OCR test</p>
                <p>

                <p>
                StoredVP found in Application Map like below:</p>
                <p>
                [SomeWindowObject]
                SomeWindowObject="Type=Something...."
                StoredVP="Coords=65,100,200,250"        --- invokes a RegionImageVP
                ....</p>
                <p>
                When the named VP (StoredVP) is found to exist in the application map as a
                subitem in the SomeWindowObject section of the map then a RegionImageVP 
                will be invoked using the value of the StoredVP item as the coordinates 
                for the region to capture.</p>  
                <p>
                StoredVP is ALSO the name of the VP which must already exist as an asset 
                of the currently running script.</p>
                <p>
                Once the unlogged VP has been completed, we attempt to retrieve the text
                of a predefined OCR region mask that should exist in the VP.  </p>
                <p>
                We can use the OCRRegion value provided from the inputrecord to identify 
                the OCR mask number as needed by the SQAGetOcrRegionText function in Robot.  
                Example 1 above shows we are looking for OCR region #1.</p>
                <p>
                The OCRRegion value in the inputrecord can also be a reference in the 
                Application Map in a section with the same name as the VP as shown below.</p>
                <p>
                [SomeWindowObject]
                SomeWindowObject="Type=Something...."
                StoredVP="Coords=65,100,200,250"
                ....</p>
                <p>
                [StoredVP]
                DataField=1
                AnotherField=2
                ....</p>
                <p>
                Example 2 above shows that we have given region #1 a name of DataField.</p>
                <p>          
                Once retrieved, the OCR text (if any) is compared against the expected 
                results provided.</p>

              <detailed_desc> 
                <p>For components that are unrecognized, like ActiveToolbar menuitems, 
                we can click on these or any part of a Window based on a stored x,y 
                coordinate.  The window containing the coordinate is first given 
                context and then a click is generated at the coordinate.  Thus, an item 
                or object can be referenced by name even though it is only recognized
                via coordinates.</p>
                <p>
                The coordinate lookup is done with the component name of the record AND 
                Field #5.</p>
                <p>
                Typical Data Table records:</p>
                <p> 
                (1) t MainWindow MainWindow Click AnObject<br/>
                (2) t MainWindow FileMenu  Click Exit</p>
                <p>
                #1 above will contain an AnObject="3,10" entry in the MainWindow section 
                of the Application Map to click at x=3, y=10 in the MainWindow.</p>
                <p>
                #2 above will contain a FileMenu entry in the MainWindow section with 
                normal recognition information for it (the type, however, should still 
                be "Window" even if unspecified).  FileMenu will also have it's
                own section in the Application Map in which there will be an entry like 
                Exit="15,30".  This will tell Robot to locate the FileMenu Window 
                object and click at the coordinates specified by the reference.</p>

                <p>This Window command has a problem in that it does not want to
                use the same recognition methods used by the other Window commands (like
                SetContext).  Particularly, it does not accept the Type=Window portion
                of these recognition methods.  In addition, if the window is a child
                window of a parent then it expects the ";ChildWindow" add-on in the 
                recognition method.  The child may also need the parent as part of its
                full recognition string like:</p>
                <p>
                ChildWindow=Type=Window;&lt;parent rec&gt;;\;Caption=&lt;caption&gt;;ChildWindow</p>
                <p>
                To handle these child windows, we parse the typical recognition method for 
                our window and attempt to handle these issues.  Once SetContext has 
                successfully set our window, we then remove any "Type=Window" substring 
                if present and add the ";ChildWindow" substring if not present.</p>
                <p>
                To take advantage of this, this routine must be called with the child
                window as a component of the parent window like below:</p>
                <p>
                t, ParentWindow, ChildWindow, CloseWindow</p>
                <p>
                If the routine is called like either of the examples below then default
                processing will occur.  This will merely SetContext on the provided 
                Window and use "CurrentWindow" as the parameter to the command.</p>

                window of a parent then it expects the ";ChildWindow" add-on in the 
                recognition method.  The child may also need the parent as part of its
                full recognition string like:</p>
                <p>
                ChildWindow=Type=Window;&lt;parent rec&gt;;\;Caption=&lt;caption&gt;;ChildWindow</p>
                <p>
                To handle these child windows, we parse the typical recognition method for 
                our window and attempt to handle these issues.  Once SetContext has 
                successfully set our window, we then remove any "Type=Window" substring 
                if present and add the ";ChildWindow" substring if not present.</p>
                <p>
                To take advantage of this, this routine must be called with the child
                window as a component of the parent window like below:</p>
                <p>
                t, ParentWindow, ChildWindow, Minimize</p>
                <p>
                If the routine is called like either of the examples below then default
                processing will occur.  This will merely SetContext on the provided 
                Window and use "CurrentWindow" as the parameter to the command.</p>
                <p>
                t, ParentWindow, ParentWindow, Minimize<br/>
                t, ChildWindow , ChildWindow , Minimize   (normally won't work)</p>

              <detailed_desc> 
                <p>Sends a SetPosition command to the window to set the position, size, 
                and status of the window.  The position, size, and status information 
                is stored in the app map as a subitem in the section for the window.
                The information should be in the format of:</p>
                <p>
                "0,0,640,480;Status=NORMAL"    OR
                "Coords=0,0,640,480;Status=NORMAL"</p>
                <p>
                That example positions the window at 0,0; sizes it to 640 x 480, and
                sets it's status to NORMAL.  Valid values for STATUS are:</p>
                <p>
                NORMAL, MINIMIZED, and MAXIMIZED</p>
                <p>
                The Window SetPosition command has a problem in that it does not want to
                use the same recognition methods used by the other Window commands (like
                SetContext).  Particularly, it does not accept the Type=Window portion
                of these recognition methods.  In addition, if the window is a child
                window of a parent then it expects the ";ChildWindow" add-on in the 
                recognition method.  The child may also need the parent as part of its
                full recognition string like:</p>
                <p>
                ChildWindow=Type=Window;&lt;parent rec&gt;;\;Caption=&lt;caption&gt;;ChildWindow</p>
                <p>
                To handle these child windows, we parse the typical recognition method for 
                our window and attempt to handle these issues.  Once SetContext has 
                successfully set our window, we then remove any "Type=Window" substring 
                if present and add the ";ChildWindow" substring if not present.</p>
                <p>
                To take advantage of this, this routine must be called with the child
                window as a component of the parent window like below:</p>
                <p>
                t, ParentWindow, ChildWindow, SetPosition, ChildPositionReference</p>
                <p>
                If the routine is called like either of the examples below then default
                processing will occur.  This will merely SetContext on the provided 
                Window and use "CurrentWindow" as the parameter to SetPosition.</p>
